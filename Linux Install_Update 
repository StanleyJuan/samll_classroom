Linux Install and Update software can separated into several situations, 


1. If we do not have the software, we have to install it at first.

We can find it on the software's official website


Under CenOS, Redhat, Debian and Ubuntu we can do like this:

wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/Python-3.6.1.tgz 


#############################################################

# use wget command before the website to download the *.tgz document

# *.tgz is same as *.zip in windows

# in this case ignore the download locaton



2. In other case, we want to find these documents on the CentOS, Debian official website

we can use


yum install [package_name]
# CentOS and Redhat




apt install [package_name]
# Debian and Ubuntu
